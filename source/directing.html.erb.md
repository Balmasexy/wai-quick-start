##  Integrate accessibility throughout your workflow

Integrate accessibility throughout all stages of design, development, and on-going maintenance. For example, consider people with disabilities as consumers during requirements planning of the website. Ensure reviews of these accessibility considerations at key phases, such as design and development sprints. Also integrate accessibility throughout your design and development resources, such as brand guidelines and code libraries.

##  Create an accessibility policy

An accessibility policy for your organization should define your goals and targets regarding the accessibility of web content and services. Ensure there is a clear indication of standards to be adhered to, scope of the policy, and milestones. Consider also an internal process for how accessibility will be monitored.

##  Provide a publicly available website accessibility statement

An external website accessibility statement should include details on conformance levels and any specific accessibility accommodations provided for users. It is also helpful to provide a contact mechanism for people who might have difficulties with the website as a result of disability.

## Identify accessibility contacts

Identify key staff who will have primary responsibility for leading accessibility activities in different areas, such as design, content creation, development, and quality assurance. In smaller teams it is likely that one individual will have primary responsibility for accessibility. Involve these contacts in planning and managing activities, and ensure their availability and buy-in.

## Provide accessibility training

Accessibility training should be provided for all team members. This includes awareness-raising and introduction to accessibility, as well as technical training and skills development for those involved in the production. For example, continual awareness-raising on how people with disabilities use the web is useful for everyone involved in design, development, and on-going maintenance.

## Plan for regular accessibility checks

Seek to identify accessibility barriers early by undertaking regular checks throughout the project life-cycle. These checks need not be extensive but should aim to identify common barriers. Such checks can also help in developing team understanding of accessibility and reinforcing good practice. More significant delivery milestones should be preceded by a comprehensive accessibility evaluation.

## Involve users with disabilities

Involing users with disabilities highlights real issues and provides practical feedback that is sometimes not easy to identify by experts alone. In particular, involving users with disabilities in usability testing helps you identify issues more efficiently and develop accessible solutions more effectively.
